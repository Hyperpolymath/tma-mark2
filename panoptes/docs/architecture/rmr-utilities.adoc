3. **CHANGELOG entries**: Named contributions
4. **MAINTAINERS.md**: Official recognition

* **Tests**: Is it well-tested?
* **Documentation**: Is it documented?
* **Style**: Does it follow conventions?
* **Security**: Is it secure?
* **Performance**: Is it efficient?

==== Non-Code Merit

* **Clarity**: Is the report/suggestion clear?
* **Completeness**: Is sufficient detail provided?
* **Usefulness**: Does it help the project?
* **Timeliness**: Is it relevant now?

=== Merit Evaluation

Merit is evaluated during:

1. **PR Review**: Code quality assessment

=== Querying Contributions

[source,bash]
----
# View contributor statistics
git shortlog -sn --all

# View contribution impact
git log --author="username" --oneline --stat

# View file contributions
git log --follow -p -- filename
----

=== Contributor Dashboard (Future)

Planned web dashboard features:

* Contribution timeline
* Merit score (if implemented)
* Badges and achievements
* Comparison with peers (opt-in)

=== Automated Recognition

[source,yaml]
----
# .github/workflows/contributor-recognition.yml
name: Recognize Contributors
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  recognize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Update contributors
        run: |
          git shortlog -sn --all > CONTRIBUTORS.txt

== Integration with MAA

RMR utilities complement MAA:

* **Reputation** → Who is accountable (trust level)
* **Merit** → What they're accountable for (contribution quality)
* **Rights** → What accountability protects (participant rights)

== Governance Integration

RMR informs governance decisions:

* **Perimeter advancement**: Based on reputation and merit
* **Voting rights**: Based on contribution level
* **Decision weight**: Higher levels have more influence
* **Conflict resolution**: Rights framework guides appeals
