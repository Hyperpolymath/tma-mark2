== Overview

Panoptes follows a Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) governance model with a structured core team. This document outlines decision-making processes, roles, succession planning, and financial transparency.

== Governance Principles

1. **Transparency**: Decisions and discussions happen in public where possible
2. **Meritocracy**: Influence earned through contribution and expertise
3. **Stability**: Predictable processes and clear authority
4. **Community**: Users and contributors shape the project's direction
5. **Sustainability**: Long-term viability over short-term gains

== Roles and Responsibilities

=== BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life)

The BDFL provides ultimate authority and vision for the project.

**Responsibilities**:

* Set overall project direction and roadmap
* Resolve disputes when consensus fails
* Appoint and remove Core team members
* Make final decisions on controversial issues
* Represent the project publicly
* Ensure long-term sustainability

**Limitations**:

* Must explain reasoning for controversial decisions
* Cannot unilaterally change this governance document
* Subject to Code of Conduct like all participants
* Must maintain succession plan

**Current BDFL**: See link:MAINTAINERS.md[MAINTAINERS.md]

=== Core Team

Core team members are trusted maintainers with significant authority.

**Responsibilities**:

* Merge permissions on all branches
* Release management and signing
* Security vulnerability response
* Architecture and design decisions
* Issue and PR triage
* Community moderation
* Mentor new contributors
* Participate in governance decisions

**Authority**:

* Can merge PRs meeting contribution standards
* Can label, close, and manage issues
* Can create releases (with BDFL approval for major)
* Can invite Perimeter 2 contributors

**Requirements**:

* 12+ months of sustained contribution
* Deep understanding of codebase
* Demonstrated good judgment
* Commitment to project values
* Two-factor authentication
* GPG signing for commits/releases

**Current Core Team**: See link:MAINTAINERS.md[MAINTAINERS.md]

=== Contributors

Contributors at all levels (Perimeter 1, 2, 3) as defined in link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc].

=== Users

The community who use Panoptes. User feedback is essential:

* Feature requests shape roadmap
* Bug reports improve quality
* Usage patterns inform priorities
* Documentation feedback improves onboarding

== Decision Making

=== Lazy Consensus

Most decisions use lazy consensus:

1. Proposal made (issue, PR, discussion, or RFC)
2. Reasonable review period:
   - Minor changes: 24-48 hours
   - Standard changes: 72 hours
   - Significant changes: 7 days
   - Breaking changes: 14 days
3. No blocking objections raised
4. Silence implies consent
5. Implementation proceeds

**Blocking objections** must:

* Provide technical or community rationale
* Suggest alternative approach
* Be made in good faith

=== Voting

When lazy consensus fails, Core team votes:

* **Eligible voters**: Core team members
* **Quorum**: Majority of Core team
* **Passing**: Simple majority (>50%)
* **Tie breaker**: BDFL decides
* **Voting period**: 7 days
* **Method**: Public vote in GitHub issue

**Voting topics**:

* New Core team members
* Removing Core team members
* Significant architecture changes
* Major dependency changes
* Policy changes

=== RFC Process

For significant changes, use Request for Comments:

1. Open issue with `RFC:` prefix
2. Describe problem and proposed solution
3. Include alternatives considered
4. Allow 14-day discussion period
5. Core team reviews and decides
6. Document decision and rationale

=== Escalation Path

1. **Discussion**: Involved parties discuss directly
2. **Mediation**: Core team member mediates
3. **Core Review**: Full Core team discusses
4. **BDFL Decision**: Final authority

== Succession Planning

=== BDFL Succession

The BDFL maintains a succession plan:

1. **Designated Successor**: Named in sealed document
2. **Succession Triggers**:
   - BDFL resignation
   - BDFL incapacity (6 months inactive)
   - BDFL removal (⅔ Core team + user vote)
3. **Transition Process**:
   - Successor announced publicly
   - 30-day transition period
   - Knowledge transfer documented
   - Access credentials transferred

=== Core Team Succession

Core team membership is not permanent:

**Becoming Core**:

1. Nomination by existing Core member
2. 14-day discussion period
3. Lazy consensus or vote
4. BDFL approval
5. Onboarding and access provisioning

**Leaving Core**:

* **Voluntary**: Announce in Core channel, 30-day transition
* **Inactivity**: 6 months inactive triggers review
* **Removal**: ⅔ Core vote for cause (CoC violation, abuse of access)

**Emeritus Status**:

Former Core members who left in good standing:

* Recognized in MAINTAINERS.md as Emeritus
* May be fast-tracked back to Core if returning
* No current access or authority

=== Project Continuity

In case of project abandonment:

1. Core team assumes collective authority
2. Community vote selects new BDFL (if desired)
3. Fork encouraged if leadership vacuum persists
4. Archive policy: Repository remains read-only for 5 years

== Release Management

=== Version Numbering

Semantic Versioning (SemVer 2.0):

* **MAJOR**: Breaking API/behavior changes
* **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
* **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

=== Release Authority

* **Patch releases**: Any Core member
* **Minor releases**: Two Core members
* **Major releases**: Core consensus + BDFL approval

=== Release Schedule

* **Patch**: As needed (security: immediate)
* **Minor**: Monthly (approximately)
* **Major**: As needed, with 3-month deprecation notice

=== Release Checklist

1. [ ] All CI checks pass
2. [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
3. [ ] Version bumped in Cargo.toml
4. [ ] Documentation updated
5. [ ] Security review (major releases)

This governance model draws inspiration from:

* Python (BDFL model)
* Rust (Core team + RFC process)
* Node.js (Technical Steering Committee)
* Apache Foundation (Meritocracy principles)
